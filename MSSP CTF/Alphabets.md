>when i was learning the alphabets , by coincidence I was thinking about using an encryption algorithm , so I try to encrypt a message and in result i get this cipher .

>cipher = "ABABB BAAAB BAAAB ABBBA AAABA BAABA AABAB AAAAB 4 AAABA ABBAB ABBAA 1 AAAAA ABBAA 1 BAAAB34 BAAAB BABBA "

>Good Luck .

It is clear that the message was encrypted by Bacon's cipher : 
Bacon's cipher or the Baconian cipher is a method of steganography.
To encode a message, each letter of the plaintext is replaced by a group of five of the letters 'A' or 'B'.
This replacement is a binary encoding and is done according to the alphabet of the Baconian cipher.
